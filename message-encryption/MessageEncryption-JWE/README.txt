JSON Web Encryption (JWE) provides confidentiality and integrity protection to 
content, using a number of common cryptographic algorithms, such as RSA and AES.


Direct JSON Web Encryption (JWE) with a shared symmetric key
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The simplest kind of encryption available in the JSON Web Encryption (JWE) 
standard is direct encryption with a shared symmetric key. 
The content is encrypted directly with the symmetric key, using a method such 
as AES/GCM, hence the name of the algorithm.
