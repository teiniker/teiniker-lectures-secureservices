Exercise: Bean Validation - Books
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Given a working REST service:
$ mvn spring-boot:run
$ curl -i -k https://localhost:8443/books

Extend the service with the following features:

A) Insert a new Book
    Add an "insert()" method to the BookController which receives a
    new "Book" object from a POST request and add it the "Map<String, Book>".
    Also create a new "id" for the Book object.

    Create a "curl" statement which inserts the following book:
    {
        "id":"",
        "author":"Sam Newman",
        "title":"Building Microservices",
        "isbn":"978-1492034025"
    }

    $ curl -ik -X POST https://localhost:8443/books -H 'Content-type:application/json' -d '{"id":"","author":"Sam Newman","title":"Building Microservices","isbn":"978-1492034025"}'

B) Bean Validation
    Add a Bean Validation for inserting new "Book" objects.
    Enforce the following constraints:
        author: not null, 5 <= length <= 255
        title: not null, 10 <= length <= 255
        isbn: Regular Expression for the following format: 978-1492034025 (only digits)
