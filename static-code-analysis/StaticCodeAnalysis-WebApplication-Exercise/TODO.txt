LabExam 2022-01-15: Static Code Analysis
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Given a legacy web application.

Use static code analysis techniques (e.g. SpotBugs, Find Security Bugs, Dependency Checker)
to find vulnerabilities in this application.

A) List all security relevant findings togethet with the corresponding code fragments.
    [2 Points]


B) Priorize the findings (what would you fix first) and describe possible
    improvements in the code. [8 Points]


C) Do you also find some more vulnerabilities during a manual code review?
    (list the code fragments and possible improvements) [Extra points]



The small print
---------------
Don't forget to replace MyName with your name, otherwise you get only 50% of
your points...

Tip: Implement the missing parts first and right before you export the project,
    rename it.

Also note that grading is based on a code review, thus, a running test doesn't
automatically mean that you get all points.
