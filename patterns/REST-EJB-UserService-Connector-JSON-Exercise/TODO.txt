Exercise: JSON Service Connector
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Setup
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
i) Make sure your database and application server is up and running.

ii) Deploy the Web service using:
    $ mvn wildfly:deploy

iii) Use "UserServiceJSONITCase" to test the running service.

Service Connector
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Within the src/test/java folder, create a class called "UserServiceConnectorJSON"
which implements the given interface "UserServiceConnector".
This class is responsible for handling the JSON based communication with the
running REST service.

You can use both SoapUI and the "UserServiceConnectorITCase" to test your
implementation.

Tipp: You can assemble the "UserServiceConnectorJSON" class from "JSONTest" and
"UserServiceJSONTest" as well as "AbstractTestBase".
