Exercise: Basic Authentication Client
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Given the existing REST service client, add a Basic Authentication header to
the HTTP request:

Authorization: Basic c3R1ZGVudDpzdHVkZW50

Calculate the value of the Autorization value like: base64(username:password)

Concrete username and password should be read from the rest.properties file:
rest.username=student
rest.password=student

Tip: For testing purposes you can de-activate TLS on the REST service.
