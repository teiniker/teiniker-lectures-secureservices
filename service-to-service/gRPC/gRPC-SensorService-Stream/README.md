# Streaming with gRPC

gRPC uses the **HTTP/2 network protocol** to do inter-service communications. 
One key advantage of HTTP/2 is that it **supports streams**. 
Each stream can multiplex multiple bidirectional messages sharing a single connection.

In gRPC, we can have streaming with three functional call types:
* **Server streaming RPC**: The client sends a single request to the server and gets back several messages that it 
    reads sequentially.
* **Client streaming RPC**: The client sends a sequence of messages to the server. 
    The client waits for the server to process the messages and reads the returned response.
* **Bidirectional streaming RPC**: The client and server can send multiple messages back and forth. 
    The messages are received in the same order that they were sent. However, the server or client can respond 
    to the received messages in the order that they choose.


## Server-Side Streaming

The client sends a single request for a quote and gets back several responses.

We add the stream keyword in front of the returned message type:
```
service SensorService
{
    rpc measure(Sensor) returns (stream SensorData);
}
```

On the **server-side**, for a single request we send back several responses to the client using the `onNext()`
method many times befor we call `onCompleted()`.

```Java
    @Override
    public void measure(Sensor sensor, StreamObserver<SensorData> responseObserver)
    {
        LOGGER.debug("measure(" + sensor + ")");

        for(int i=0; i<10; i++)
        {
            SensorData data = SensorData.newBuilder()
                .setSensorType(SensorType.DHT11)
                .setValue(20.0 + i)
                .setUnitOfMeasurement("Â°C")
                .build();
            responseObserver.onNext(data);
        }
        responseObserver.onCompleted();
    }
```

On the **client-side**, the server's remote method returns an `Iterator<>` of message instances which we
can use to iterate over the received data.

```Java
    @Test
    public void testDHT11Sensor()
    {
        Sensor sensor = Sensor.newBuilder().setType(SensorType.DHT11).build();
        Iterator<SensorData> dataList = service.measure(sensor);

        for(int i = 1; dataList.hasNext(); i++)
        {
            SensorData data = dataList.next();
            System.out.printf("Sensor Data %d: %s\n", i, data.toString());
        }
    }
```

Remember, an `Iterator<>` interface provides the methods `hasNext()` and `next()` which can be used to 
visit all elements of a given data structure.
